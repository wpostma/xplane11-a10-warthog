XPLane 11 RElease : Version 1.3.1 (2021) prepared by Warren Postma. Dec 2021.
========================================

* Moved from XPlane 10 to 11, obsolete instruments (that do not function in XPlane 11) removed to remove errors when saving in Plane Maker.
* Fixed HUD shadow issue by removing the HUD texture (a smoked plastic 80% transparent, that is becoming 100% opaque in engine when shadows fell on it).

Known problems in 1.3.1
* DME/VOR/TACAN not working. Plan is to fix this.
